**Client:** Prestige Printing House  
**Participants:** 
- **Development Team:** Jurgen , Arlindo , Uendi
- **Client Representatives:** Client 1 (Owner), Client 2 (Production Manager)

### Meeting Transcript

**Jurgen:** "Thank you for meeting with us today. We'd like to understand your current workflow and the challenges you're facing."

**Client 1:** "Our main challenge is managing customer orders efficiently. Currently, people call or email us with book printing requests, but there's no standardized system."

**Client 2:** "Yes, and that leads to miscommunication. Sometimes we miss important details about binding types or paper specifications."

**Arlindo:** "Could you walk us through a typical order from start to finish?"

**Client 2:** "A customer contacts us with their book project. We discuss their requirements‚Äîbinding style, paper quality, dimensions, color options, quantity needed, and delivery timeline. Then we prepare a quote, get approval, receive their files, and begin production."

**Uendi:** "Do you currently use any digital systems we should be aware of?"

**Client 1:** "We use QuickBooks for accounting and track our paper inventory in Excel spreadsheets. Nothing sophisticated."

**Jurgen:** "What are your expectations for this new system?"

**Client 1:** "We need something that lets customers place orders online with all their specifications clearly defined. And our staff needs to see these orders, track them through production, and communicate with customers about design options."

**Arlindo:** "I'd like to understand the customer experience better. What customization options are most important to offer?"

**Client 2:** "Definitely binding types‚Äîhardcover, paperback, spiral, saddle-stitch. Paper selection is crucial too‚Äîweight, finish, color. Book dimensions, cover design options, and quantity pricing are also important."

**Uendi:** "How do you handle file submissions currently?"

**Client 2:** "Mostly email attachments, sometimes cloud links. We accept PDFs, Word documents, and InDesign files primarily."

**Jurgen:** "Let's talk volume. How many orders do you typically process in a month?"

**Client 1:** "Around 200 orders per month, but it's growing. That's part of why we need a better system."
