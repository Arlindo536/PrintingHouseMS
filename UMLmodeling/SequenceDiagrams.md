# 📊 PrintingHouseMS Sequence Diagrams 📊

## 🌟 Overview

This document explains the sequence diagrams created for the PrintingHouseMS system. Sequence diagrams illustrate how objects interact in a time sequence, showing the chronological flow of messages between components.

## 🔍 Why Sequence Diagrams?

- ⏱️ Show **timing and order** of interactions
- 🔄 Illustrate **dynamic behavior** of the system
- 🧩 Focus on **message exchange** between components
- 📋 Document **process flows** clearly

## 📑 Included Diagrams

### 1️⃣ Order Placement Sequence 📝

**Key Interactions:**
- 👤 Customer configures book specifications
- 📤 Manuscript files are uploaded and validated
- 💰 Dynamic pricing is calculated
- 📋 Order is created and payment processed
- ✉️ Order confirmation is returned to customer

**Business Value:**
- Streamlines the ordering process
- Ensures all book specifications are captured
- Provides real-time pricing to customers

### 2️⃣ Production Workflow Sequence 🏭

![Production Workflow Sequence Diagram](../Diagrams/ProductionWorkflowSequence.svg)

**Key Interactions:**
- 📋 Order management creates production orders
- 👨‍🔧 Staff members are assigned to production stages
- 🔄 Multiple production stages are tracked (prepress, printing, binding)
- 🔔 Notifications are sent as stages complete
- 📱 Status updates are provided to customers

**Business Value:**
- Tracks production progress through all stages
- Notifies customers of milestones automatically
- Manages staff assignments effectively

### 3️⃣ Order Tracking Sequence 🔍

**Key Interactions:**
- 👤 Customer logs in and requests order status
- 🔎 System retrieves order details
- 🏭 Production stage information is gathered
- 📦 Shipping information is collected
- 📱 Complete tracking information is displayed

**Business Value:**
- Provides transparency to customers
- Reduces customer service inquiries
- Builds customer confidence and satisfaction

## 💡 Implementation Notes

- Each diagram follows UML 2.0 sequence diagram notation
- Activation boxes indicate when objects are actively processing
- Return messages are shown with dashed lines
- Self-calls indicate internal processing

## 🔄 How These Diagrams Connect

These three sequence diagrams represent the key processes in the PrintingHouseMS system:

1. **Order Placement** initiates the customer journey
2. **Production Workflow** shows how orders are fulfilled
3. **Order Tracking** demonstrates how customers monitor progress

Together, they provide a comprehensive view of the system's dynamic behavior from order to delivery.
